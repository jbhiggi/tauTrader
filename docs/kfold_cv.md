# K-Fold Cross Validation and Threshold Mapping

## 1. Standard Train/Validation/Test Split
In a typical ML workflow, the dataset is divided into three sets:

- **Training set** → used to fit the model weights.  
- **Validation set** → used to tune hyperparameters and choose thresholds (e.g., classification probability cutoffs).  
- **Test set** → held out until the very end to estimate generalization performance.  

**Drawback:** with small datasets, the validation results may be noisy and the test set only gets used once.


## 2. K-Fold Cross Validation
K-fold cross validation provides a more robust alternative:

1. Split the training+validation portion of the data into **K folds** (e.g., K=5).  
2. For each fold *i*:  
   - Train on K−1 folds (the **train** part).  
   - Validate on the remaining fold (the **val** part).  
   - Record model metrics, especially the **optimal validation threshold**.  
3. Average the results across folds for stability.  

$$
\{\tau_{\text{val}}^1, \tau_{\text{val}}^2, \dots, \tau_{\text{val}}^K\}
$$

## 3. Role of the Test Set
The test set remains **untouched** during k-fold CV.  

After cross-validation:  
- Evaluate the model (using the learned threshold rule) on the test set.  
- For each fold, compute:  
  - τ_val → chosen from the validation split of that fold.  
  - τ_test → the actual best threshold on the held-out test set.  

This yields paired data points.

$$
(\tau_{\text{val}}, \tau_{\text{test}})
$$

## 4. Fitting the Linear Relation Between Validation and Test Thresholds
Validation thresholds are often biased compared to test thresholds. To correct this, fit a simple linear regression.

$$
\tau_{\text{test}} \approx a \cdot \tau_{\text{val}} + b
$$

- Collect all pairs (τ_val, τ_test) from k folds.  
- Fit the regression to learn mapping coefficients a, b.  
- Use this mapping to adjust future validation thresholds into better test-set estimates.

## 5. Why This Works
- **Cross-validation** gives multiple validation–test pairs rather than just one.  
- This enables a statistical estimate of how thresholds generalize.  
- The **linear correction** captures systematic bias (e.g., validation thresholds consistently too low or too high compared to test thresholds).  


## ✅ Summary
K-fold CV cycles through validation splits to provide robust estimates of optimal thresholds. By comparing validation and test thresholds across folds, we can fit a linear mapping.

$$
\tau_{\text{test}} = a \cdot \tau_{\text{val}} + b
$$

This relation allows us to directly predict the likely optimal test threshold from a validation threshold in future experiments.
